Coastal zones are highly dynamic systems in the ocean-continent interface, and thus particularly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic changes. Mapping the distinct land cover (e.g. anthropic occupation, vegetation, beach areas) and changes over time is crucial to understand and manage these complex regions. Multi-spectral satellite imagery is an efficient methodological approach for land cover classification, being widely used in coastal and continental environments. The near-global coverage, moderate spatial resolution (between 10 and 30 metres for freely available imagery) and revisit time (16-day) are some aspects that make this data source highly useful for monitoring purposes. In this work, we present a tool to map and analyse distinct land cover in coastal zones, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. GEE is a planetary-scale platform with freely available satellite imagery database (Landsat and Sentinel missions) and access to Googleâ€™s cloud computing infrastructure, which is outstanding for demanding computer operations such as image processing. The tool presented here was built using GEE API functionalities, and has a friendly graphical user interface where the user can perform several operations in either a single image or over a period of time, such as applying different image classification algorithms, performing image transformations with well-known methods (i.e. NDWI and NDVI) as well as custom-built ones, analyzing land cover and coastline changes over time and visualizing the results on an embedded map window. Results obtained can be saved in standard formats (e.g., GeoJSON and KML), allowing the user to export these datasets for usage in any other GIS system.
