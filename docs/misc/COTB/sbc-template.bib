  title={Coastline changes. A global review},
  abstractNote={This book describes and analyzes the pattern of advance and retreat on the world’s coastlines in recent decades. Summarizing and illustrating the evidence for coastline changes and discussing possible explanations, it provides an analytical framework for the elucidation of process and change in coastal environments. More than two-thirds of the book is devoted to the evidence of coastal change in 95 countries. This is followed by discussions of the varied categories of coastal change including cliffed, glaciated and periglaciated, emerging and submerging, volcanic, deltaic, swampy, and artificial coastlines.},

abstract="This study aims to assess the potential of several ancillary input data for the improvement of unsupervised land cover change detection in arid environments. The study area is located in Central Iraq where desertification has been observed. We develop a new scheme based on known robust indices. We employ Landsat (multispectral scanner, thematic mapper, and enhanced thematic mapper) satellite data acquired in 1976, 1990, and 2002. We use the Normalized Deferential Vegetation Index, Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), Salinity Index (SI), and Eolian Mapping Index. Two new equations were applied for the SI and the NDWI indices. Validation was performed using ground truth data collected in 16 days. We show that such an approach allows a robust and low-cost alternative for preliminary and large-scale assessments. This study shows that desertification has increased in the study area since 1990.",
